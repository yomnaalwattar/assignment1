            The orbit of the Moon is a nearly circular ellipse about the Earth (the semimajor and semiminor axes are 384,400 km and 383,800 km, respectively: a difference of only 0.16%).<br>
             The equation of the ellipse yields an eccentricity of 0.0549 and perigee  and apogee distances of 362,600 km and 405,400 km respectively (a difference of 12%).<br>

            Since nearer objects appear larger, the Moon's apparent size changes as it moves toward and away from an observer on Earth. An event referred to as a 'supermoon' occurs when the full Moon is at its closest to Earth . <br>
            The largest possible apparent diameter of the Moon is the same 12% larger (as perigee versus apogee distances) than the smallest; the apparent area is 25% more and so is the amount of light it reflects toward Earth.<br>
            
            The variance in the Moon's orbital distance corresponds with changes in its tangential and angular speeds, as stated in Kepler's second law. The mean angular movement relative to an imaginary observer at the Earth–Moon barycentre is 13.176° per day to the east (J2000.0 epoch).
